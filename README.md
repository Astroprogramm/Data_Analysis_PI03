Data transfer and communication is mostly done through the internet, landlines, mobile phones, almost anywhere in the world.

Compared to the world average, Argentina is at the forefront of telecommunications development, having a total of 62.12 million connections by 2020

**Description:**

### PROJECT DEVELOPMENT

The project was developed on a notebook on the Google Colab platform, which describes the entire EDA process (exploratory data analysis) and its conclusions.
This notebook is present in this repository as EDA-PI03.ipynb

The datasets where requested from the API available in the site on a Google Sheets file with Apps Scripts tool (both files are in the repository), and from there exported to a Data Studio Looker dashboard. The dashboard can be access in this link: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1592950630581-03cb41342cc5?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb
